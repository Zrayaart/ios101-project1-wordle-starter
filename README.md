# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Soraya Sardine

"Wordle" is an app that allows you to guess a five-letter word. 
If you guess the word correctly, you are a winner! 
In case you can't guess the full word, the app will show you which letters are correct. 
If a letter is in the correct spot, it will turn green. 
If the letter is correct, but it's not in the right spot, it will turn yellow.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total
